dedub
=====

Get rid of those pesky dubdubdubs. Redirects all requests to the requested URL, minus the leading host.

For example:

`www.hello.com` will redirect to `hello.com`

This is probably only useful for redirecting from a `www`-prefixed domain to the naked domain, but who knows, maybe it's good for something else.
